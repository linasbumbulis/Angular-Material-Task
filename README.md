Angular Material and Routing
--------------

A small and simple single page web page, using angular and material design (https://material.angularjs.org). No backend, just some fake hardcoded data in JavaScript.

Using ngRoute for the routing.https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute

The app doesn't need to do much, just a front page with a form with some buttons and a second page that displays some data.
